# Aegle dev test
Aegle landing page built in React from scratch

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

## Features

1. React v18
2. Scss
3. Styled Components

## To improve

This is the result of two days of work. Many improvements can be made, here are a couple of them that i couldn't implement due to deadline.

1. Some styling was made with pure scss and other with styled components. Using styled components for every component would make the project more consistent.
2. The page is quiet responsive but not completely. A couple of media queries for some breakpoints would improve this aspect.
3. An index that joins all assets could prevent components from doing to much imports. Same for components.
